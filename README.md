## Dice

We should check if we have a good chance of winning in a game with two dice. The values of
the dice are added. We start the game with 50c. The profit is computed with the following table

| Sum       | Payback    | Profit     |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 12        | 4x input   | +1,50 Euro |
| 11        | 3x input   | +1,00 Euro |
| 10        | 2x input   | +0,50 Euro |
| 7,8,9     | input back | +0,00 Euro |
| 2,3,4,5,6 | none       | -0,50 Euro |

Is it good to take part in this game? Try in a loop with 1000 iterations, if you lose or win in the long run. You can simulate the dice with random numbers.
